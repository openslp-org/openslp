                    <h2>History</h2>
                    <p>The OpenSLP project was started by Caldera Systems, Incorporated, a linux distributor based in Orem, Utah, in the mid 90's. Caldera has since merged with SCO and been renamed <em>The SCO Group</em>.</p>
                    <p>The original author of the OpenSLP source code was Matthew Peterson, an employee of Caldera. In early 2004 Matt left Caldera, inviting Bryant Eastham of emWare to take over the project. Bryant, in accordance with the goals of his company, added complete support for IPv6. A year later, Bryant passed the project on to John Calcote, then of Novell. While John continues management of the project today, most of the real work is done by the rest of the OpenSLP team.</p>
                    <h2>Team Members</h2>
                    <p>The current members of the OpenSLP development team are comprised both of employees of companies with an interest in using SLP within their products, and of individual contributors who have an interest in service advertising and open source in general. (Note: Except for the project maintainer, team members are listed in random order.)</p>

OpenSLP Change Log
------------------

Please make entries to this log (in addition to the CVS log) that describe 
major changes to the OpenSLP code base.  An entries should be separated by
blank lines and include the date, developer's email, and change description.
=============================================================================

11/2/00 mpeterson@caldera.com
Removed ALL memory leaks from slpd and libslp (predicate code not done yet)

10/31/00 mpeterson@caldera.com
libslp now asks slpd for known DAs before multicasting requests

10/31/00 mpeterson@caldera.com
Slpd running as a DA now performs passive discovery

10/25/00 mpeterson@caldera.com
Slpd running as an SA now re-registers all services with a new DA

10/17/00 mpeterson@caldera.com
Added code to database to utilized revised libslpattr call.  Now taglists in
AttrRqsts are honored

10/17/00 mpeterson@caldera.com
Added some significant fixes to make slpd work properly on multi-homed 
machines

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.7 ***

10/11/00 mpeterson@caldera.com
Rewrote the README file and removed README.CVS.

10/11/00 mpeterson@caldera.com
Made changes to configure.in so that new predicate code is not build by
default.  Also added old predicate code back in (behind #ifdefs) so that at
least the original functionality will be there for 0.7.7

10/06/00 mpeterson@caldera.com
Added code to make libslp reuse TCP connections

10/06/00 mpeterson@caldera.com
Fixed timing bug in slpd where in some cases a non-blocking recvfrom() was 
called before any data could possibly be in the stream.  This would cause
libslp to return unexplained -19 on SLPReg() and friends.

10/05/00 mpeterson@caldera.com
Active DA discovery is now working correctly.  There is still need for 
code to be added so the DAAdvert statless bootstamp is honored correctly.
The SA should re-register all services with a DA if it is new or bootstamp
is stale

09/29/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
Implemented SLPv1 support when running as a DA. This can be turned off by the
configure option --disable-slpv1. New files common/slp_v1message.h,
common/slp_v1message.c, slpd/slpd_v1process.c. SLPv1 packets can have multiple
character encodings, OpenSLP supports only ASCII and Unicode encodings.

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.6 ***

09/27/00 hughes@lab43.org
Changed slpd's internal representation of attributes to use libslpattr. This
gives  much finer control over attributes, paving the way for filter support
and attribute freshening. 

09/27/00 hughes@lab43.org
Integrated filter support into slpd. This can be found in 
slpd/slpd_predicate.*. Regression test added in test.  

09/19/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
Changed slpd to bind the multicast socket to INADDR_ANY instead of the SLP 
multicast address. Binding to the multicast address causes BSD derived OSs
to put the multicast address instead of the host address on outgoing packets.
With this fix (and a couple of others), OpenSLP works on FreeBSD and 
Compaq Tru64. 

09/18/00 mdes@ocegr.fr
Added Rick Braddy's MSVC Project files so that now OpenSLP should compile 
easily on Windows machines in Visual Studio

09/05/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Finally was able to reproduce (thanks to Jon) and fix bugs 109358 and 109359

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.5 ***

09/05/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Merged Mattieu Desmons's Win32 port of OpenSLP

09/05/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
SLPFindSrvTypes() implemented (both server and client side)
	
*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.4 ***

8/30/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Finally added functionality to slpd so that as an SA  it will find and 
register with all known DAs.  

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.2 ****

08/16/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Made significant changes that streamline main execution loop of slpd. 

08/11/00 mpeterson@calderassystems.com
Fixed several sneeky memory leaks and memory access bugs that delt with
langtags in libslp. Fixes bug #111058 - Pointer issues in slpd.

08/04/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
OpenSLP ported to Solaris (2.6/7) and Linux Alpha. Also functional on
Compaq Tru64. Building is now possible on non-gcc compilers.

08/04/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
Documentation updates - codeset converted to iso-8859-1 and spell checked.

08/04/00 david.mccormack@ottawa.com
Modified slpd command line parameter parsing to print version and help 
information

08/02/00 rganesan@myrealbox.com
Build changes to take advantage of automake/libtool integration. Building 
with builddir != srcdir works. DESTDIR is supported for make install to
ease packaging. Test suites are integrated and run using 'make check'.  

07/17/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Finalized the DA discovery routines in libslp

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.7.1 ***

07/11/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Fixed 109269 - SLPFindSrvs callback no longer gives a LAST_CALL

07/11/00 david.mccormack@ottawa.com
Added a --enable-debug parameter to the configure script.  This option 
when activated allows for all the debug parameters to be set.

07/10/00 david.mccormack@ottawa.com
Fixxed a short coming of SLPEscape, it did not handle CTL, which it now 
does.

07/06/00 david.mccormack@ottawa.com
Removed all old Makefile and install scripts and replaced them with 
Automake/Autoconf ones.

07/06/00 david.mccormack@ottawa.com
Added in a NEWS file

06/28/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Added multicast DA discover support to the library

06/28/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Centralized the request reply engine for the library to libslp_network.c

06/28/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Added support for net.slp.multicastTimeouts, net.slp.unicastTimeout, and
net.slp.DADiscoveryTimeouts

06/13/00 david.mccormack@ottawa.com
Added in SLPUnescape function, and changed the documentation to reflect 
it.

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.6.7 ***

06/12/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Added support for slp.net.DAAddresses to libslp.

06/12/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com

06/12/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Fixed 107022 - Seg Fault when net.slp.interfaces specified in slp.conf

05/30/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Fixed make files so that a make clean is done before a make install

*** TAG OpenSLP 0.6.6 ***

05/25/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Added code to enable slpd to reply to service:service-agent SrvRqsts

05/24/00 mpeterson@calderasystem.com
Added an SLP test suite that was written by David McCormack.

05/24/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Fixed 106298 - SLPFindAttrs does not find all attributes

05/18/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Added the traceReg feature

05/18/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Fixed #106044 - Quoted strings in slp.reg cause seg fault in slpd

05/17/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Fixed #105904 - SLPOpen does not return SLP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED

05/15/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Fixed a major bug that caused the library to freeze when slp.conf was changed

05/15/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Brushed up traceMsg a little more.  Needs a little more work to be really
useful.  The framework is there though.	 
 
05/12/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
Add framework to support traceMsg functionality.  Still needs a little 
brushing up, but the main part is done.

05/03/00 mpeterson@calderasystems.com
This is another sample entry to show that entries should be separated by

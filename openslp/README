1 - Introduction
-----------------
The OpenSLP project is an effort to develop an open-source implementation of
Service Location Protocol suitable for commercial and non-commercial 
application.

OpenSLP 1.1.1 is a develper release of the cutting edge OpenSLP code.  If you
are looking for a stable release, you should download the latest revision of
the 1.0.x series. 

OpenSLP 1.1.1 is the first release of the 1.1.x series.  Several significant
changes have been made that are not part of the 1.0.x releases.  A list of
these changes as well as a list of known issues follows:

Changes:
   
   - Significant changes have been made in multicasting send code.  These
     changes are highlighted by the addition of several new files and
     functions like those found in common/slp_iface.c common/slp_xcast.c,
     and libslp_network.c.
     
   - Several changes have been made to consolidate common code.  Please
     notice several new files in common directory

   - Significant changes were made to provide a PID watching feature.  In 
     OpenSLP 1.1.x slpd will watch the "PIDs" of processes that register
     via the SLPReg() API.  If the registering process dies unexpectedly,
     slpd will automatically deregister the registered services.

Known Issues:

   - Much of the new code is not ported to platforms other than Linux.  Please
     feel free to send patches for your OS directly to me or to the
     openslp-devel@sourceforge.net mailing list.

      
2 - Roadmap
------------
For more information about the roadmap for OpenSLP 1.1.x please take a look at

3 - Building OpenSLP
---------------------
Building OpenSLP requires the proper installation of automake, autoconf and
libtool.  To build OpenSLP please use the following steps:

    - Unzip and untar the openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz tarball.
   
      $ tar -zxf openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz 
          
    - Run the autogen.sh script to generate configure script. Do not be
      alarmed if the autogen script prints a few errors.  Try the resulting
      configure (next step) script anyway.  If the ./configure script already
      exists, skip running ./autogen.sh
      
      $ cd openslp-x.x.x
      $ ./autogen.sh
          
    - Run the configure script to create openslp make files.  Please note that
      the configure script accepts several --enable-xxxx and --disable-xxxx
      options that should be interesting to you.  Run ./configure --help and 
      read the details of each of these switches. If the configure
      script fails... now you have a problem.
     
      $ ./configure --help
      $ ./configure
          
    - Run the top level make file (you need to use GNU make)
    
      $ make
          
    - If the make is successful, look for the following binaries:
      
      slpd/slpd
      libslp/.libs/libslp.so
      test/.libs/*


4 - Installing OpenSLP       
-----------------------
To install OpenSLP make the install target in the top level make file
    
    $ make install
    
Installation of OpenSLP creates the following files:
    
    /usr/sbin/slpd 
    /usr/lib/libslp.so.x.x (and several appropriate links)
    /usr/lib/libslp.a 
    /etc/slp.conf          (old slp.conf is renamed)
    /etc/slp.reg           (old slp.reg is renamed)
    

5 - OpenSLP Users Guide 
------------------------
Rather than be repetitive in this document, the reader is refered to a fairly
complete OpenSLP users guide that is available in the doc/html directory
of the OpenSLP distribution or on the web at:
    
    http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/UsersGuide
    
The OpenSLp users guide gives instruction on how network and system
administrators should configure and use OpenSLP once it is installed


6 - OpenSLP Programmers Guide
------------------------------
Again, to avoid repetition, the reader is refered to a the Programmers Guide
available in the doc/html directory of the OpenSLP distribution or on the web 
at:
   
    http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/ProgrammersGuide
    
    
7 - FAQ
--------
The frequently asked questions have been moved to a faq.html file located in 
the doc directory of the OpenSLP tarball.

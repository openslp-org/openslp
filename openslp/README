1 - Introduction
-----------------
The OpenSLP project is an effort to develop an open-source implementation of
Service Location Protocol suitable for commercial and non-commercial 
application.

The latest version of OpenSLP is 0.9.0  Release notes for this version follow:
Due to the need to make some significant changes to the code, we have
decided to make one final major release before 1.0.x.  Most of the changes
in OpenSLP 0.9.0 were required to add SLPv2
authentication support.  The most obvious difference between 0.9.0 and
previous releases is a rewrite of the internal database used to store
registrations and known DAs.  Instead of copying fields
from SrvReg and DAAdvert messages, the registration and known DA databases
now save off the entire message along with the SLPMessage descriptor.  This
allows for slightly faster processing, but
more importantly, it allows for storage of authentication information in a
way that does not require the SA or DA to have to recalculate signatures for
each reply. 

The following is a shortened list changes for 0.9.0: 

 - Full SLPv2 Authentication support
 - Completely new internal registration and knownDA database implementation 
 - Optional net.slp.checkSourceAddr security feature
 - Support for net.slp.OpenSLPVersion
 - Support for special service-types -- service:directory-agent and 
   service:service-agent can now be used in calls to SLPFindSrvs()
 - Changes to libslp to prepare for collation in 0.9.1
 - Fixes for sever socket reconnect, reuse, and aging bugs
 - Fixes for several slp.reg parsing errors.
 - Fixed for "invalid predicate" SEGV
 - Debug logging of registrations and known DAs on receipt of SIGINT
 - Debug malloc wrappers       
       
2 - Roadmap
------------
OpenSLP is getting very close to being released nd beta form.  It is 
currently useable for most applications, but still lacks a few important
features:
    
    - libslp does not collate results for syncronous calls
    - libslp does not support asyncronous calls


3 - Building OpenSLP
---------------------
Building OpenSLP requires the proper installation of automake, autoconf and
libtool.  To build OpenSLP please use the following steps:

    - Unzip and untar the openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz tarball.
   
      $ tar -zxf openslp-x.x.x.tar.gz 
	  
    - Run the autogen.sh script to generate configure script. Do not be
      alarmed if the autogen script prints a few errors.  Try the resulting
      configure (next step) script anyway.  If the ./configure script already
      exists, skip running ./autogen.sh
      
      $ cd openslp-x.x.x
      $ ./autogen.sh
	  
    - Run the configure script to create openslp make files.  Please note that
      the configure script accepts several --enable-xxxx and --disable-xxxx
      options that should be interesting to you.  Run ./configure --help and 
      read the details of each of these switches. If the configure
      script fails... now you have a problem.
     
      $ ./configure --help
      $ ./configure
	  
    - Run the top level make file (you need to use GNU make)
    
      $ make
	  
    - If the make is successful, look for the following binaries:
      
      slpd/slpd
      libslp/.libs/libslp.so
      test/.libs/*


4 - Installing OpenSLP       
-----------------------
To install OpenSLP make the install target in the top level make file
    
    $ make install
    
Installation of OpenSLP creates the following files:
    
    /usr/sbin/slpd 
    /usr/lib/libslp.so.x.x (and several appropriate links)
    /usr/lib/libslp.a 
    /etc/slp.conf          (old slp.conf is renamed)
    /etc/slp.reg           (old slp.reg is renamed)
    

5 - OpenSLP Users Guide 
------------------------
Rather than be repetitive in this document, the reader is refered to a fairly
complete OpenSLP users guide that is available in the doc/html directory
of the OpenSLP distribution or on the web at:
    
    http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/UsersGuide
    
The OpenSLp users guide gives instruction on how network and system
administrators should configure and use OpenSLP once it is installed


6 - OpenSLP Programmers Guide
------------------------------
Again, to avoid repetition, the reader is refered to a the Programmers Guide
available in the doc/html directory of the OpenSLP distribution or on the web 
at:
   
    http://www.openslp.org/doc/html/ProgrammersGuide
    
    
7 - FAQ
--------
The frequently asked questions have been moved to a faq.html file located in 
the doc directory of the OpenSLP tarball.

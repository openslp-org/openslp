* Fixed minor KnownDAEcho problem that resulted in some DAs not getting
  registrations.

  that can generate different package formats from a single list file).

* Fix for "invalid predicate" SEGV.
* Debug logging of registrations and known DAs on receipt of SIGINT.
* Debug malloc wrappers.

New in openslp-0.8.3 (2001-03-13)
---------------------------------
* Completely updated Win32 port
* Preliminary support for asyncronous API calls is now a compile time option.
  Async calls still not fully supported.
* Addition of SLPParseAttr() API that complies with what will be in RFC2614bis
  (Note: the libslp.so library version is now 0.0.3)
* Many fixes to documentation based on review feedback from debian 
  developer Susan G. Kleinmann (sgk@debian.org).
* Many bug fixes including the following:
     - "DAs with multiple scopes" bug
     - "Local service time out on DA" bug
     - "Bad 1400 byte message" bug

New in openslp-0.8.2 (2001-02-14)
---------------------------------
* Minor fixes in the html documentation.
* Bug fixes (including "slpd tight loop" problem)
* Logging changes (no log file truncation and log timestamps)
* Corrections in the usage of DAAdvert bootstamps, scopelists,
  and XIDs   
* Several documentation corrections
* Massive Win32 specific changes.  Please read README.WIN32 !     

New in openslp-0.8.1 (2000-12-19)
---------------------------------
* slpd now correctly refreshes and ages services as required by DA and SA 
  specifications
* Location of slpd.pid and slpd.log files now depends on the configure prefix 
  on Unix.
* slpd running as a DA now sends passive DAAdverts for SLPv1 also. 
* slpd now works (again) on 64-bit platforms. 

New in openslp-0.8.0 (2000-11-30)
--------------------------------
* New OpenSLP License.  OpenSLP is now licensed under the BSD license.
* OpenSLP contrib tarball is now available.  OpenSLP Contrib is a collection
  of SLP related utilities and tools.
* Predicate support now enabled by default.
* SLPFindScopes() is now implemented to RFC spec.
* Implemented SLPFindScopes() in libslp.
* Send dead DAAdvert as part of graceful shutdown.
* DAs now echo local registrations to other DAs (slpd as a DA also acts like
  an SA for local API callers).
* Added code to ensure we respond correctly (with AUTHENICATION_UNKNOWN)
  when a request with a SPI is received.
* Changed SLPD behaviour to be less destructive on SIGHUP.  SIGHUP no longer
  dumps the entire registration database on SIGHUP.  SIGHUP only causes slpd
  to re-read configuration and static registration as well as perform DA
  discovery. 


New in openslp-0.7.8 (2000-11-06)
---------------------------------
* slpd now does a graceful shutdown on SIGTERM to deregister serviced
  with DAs
* Considerable time spend using commercial debugging tools to remove
  ALL memory leaks from slpd (without predicates) and libslp.
* IPC (via loopback) is now used by libslp to obtain DA information
  from slpd before multicasting
* slpd running as a DA now sends passive DAAdverts
* slpd running as an SA now performs active DA discovery
* slpd running as an SA now re-registers all services with new DAs
* Significant fixes were made to make slpd work properly on multi-homed machines  


New in openslp-0.7.7: (2000-10-11)
----------------------------------
* OpenSLP now supports SLPv1 when run as a DA.
* TCP stream reusage was added to libslp and slpd
* Correction of many active DA discovery problems were made in slpd
* Predicate features from 0.7.6 are not build by default because of a
  few problems that will be corrected for 0.7.8         


New in openslp-0.7.6: (2000-9-28)
----------------------------------
* OpenSLP ported to FreeBSD. Compaq Tru64 support is also complete.
* Full predicate support has been added to OpenSLP.  slpd will now correctly 
  answer service requests containing LDAP filters
* As part of the Windows port, the MSVC project files added.  This should
  make it much easier for OpenSLP to be build on Win32 platform.
* Most of slpd and libslp code was tested against a malloc debugger.  Several
  bugs and memory leaks were fixed.


New in openslp-0.7.5: (2000-09-08)
----------------------------------
* OpenSLP ported to Win32.
* SLPFindSrvTypes() now works.
* libslp minor version updated.


New in openslp-0.7.4: (2000-09-01)
----------------------------------
* Finally added SA <--> DA communication resulting in an slpd that now acts as
  a much better SA and DA.  
* slpd (as a DA) responds to active DA discovery requests.
* slpd (as an SA) performs active DA discovery, supports passive DA discovery,
  supports static DA configuration, registers and de-registers services with 
  DAs.
* libslp now has the ability to register services with to the local slpd
  (SA), or a discovered DA.  This eliminates the need to have slpd running on
  all machines in certain cases. libslp can now request services from a DA 
  or via multicast or broadcast.
  

New in openslp-0.7.3:
---------------------
* openslp-0.7.3 will not be released.


New in openslp-0.7.2: (2000-08-17)
----------------------------------
* Revamped build system.
  Takes advantage of libtool/automake integration.
  libslp versioning changed to be compatible with libtool.
  Building with non-GCC compilers is now possible.
  Build directory can be different from source directory.
  Test suite integrated with automake, run make check to run the test suite.
* Fixed several sneaky memory leaks and memory access bugs that dealt with
  langtags in libslp 
* Modified slpd command line parameter parsing to print version and help
  information  
* Ported to Solaris (2.6/7) and Linux Alpha.
* Documentation cleaned up (code set changed to iso8859-1 and spell checked).

New in openslp-0.7.1:
---------------------
* Several bug fixes.
* Now uses Autoconf/Automake.


New in openslp-0.7.0: (2000-07-06)
----------------------------------
* Addition of NEWS file.
* Move of CHANGELOG to ChangeLog.

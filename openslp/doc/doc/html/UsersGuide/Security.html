Security</h2>

<h3>Protecting the daemon against attacks</h3>
The following measures have been taken to protect the OpenSLP daemon
from
attacks:
<ul>
  <li>
The OpenSLP daemon (slpd) must run as root initially in order to bind
to
the well known SLP port.&nbsp; However, slpd will relinquish root
privileges
and suid() to the daemon user (if it exists).</li>
  <li>
If slpd includes paranoid SLP message checking code .&nbsp; This slows
down the operation of slpd slightly but ensures that malformed or
intentionally
malicious SLP messages will not cause segmentation faults in the daemon.</li>
</ul>
<h3>
Protecting the integrity of service registrations</h3>
As of version 0.9.0, OpenSLP fully supports the SLPv2 message
authentication
blocks to ensure that registrations can not be modified in transit and
that they are sent to and received from valid agents.&nbsp;&nbsp; When
properly installed and configured, OpenSLP will automatically provide
this
level of security to all SLP enabled applications with out any need to
recompile or relink.&nbsp;&nbsp; Installation of secure OpenSLP is a
little
involved...
<p>Currently, OpenSLP uses DSS signatures to ensure the authenticity
and
integrity of certain SLP messages.&nbsp; In order to do this,
administrators
need to: build a security enabled OpenSLP, provide&nbsp; (or generate)
a DSA&nbsp; public and private keys, and setup the /etc/slp.spi
file.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The administrator also has to ensure that OpenSSL crypto libraries are
properly installed before secure OpenSLP will work.
</p>
<p>Step 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; Since we not sure how many installations will
require
OpenSLP security so the security features&nbsp; are not currently built
in by default.&nbsp; To build a security into open slp OpenSLP you will
have to use --enable-security on the ./configure command line
</p>
<p>Step 2:&nbsp; Generate DSA public and private key files in PEM
format
using the OpenSSL command line.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll provide details on
exactly
how this is done when I get more time in the mean time, you can figure
it out by reading the openssl man pages.
</p>
<p>Step 3: Copy the private DSA key PEM key file to very safe locations
on hosts that will be registering services.&nbsp; The public DSA key
PEM
file goes on all hosts that will be registering services and on all
hosts
that will be finding services.
</p>
<p>Step 4: Edit the /etc/slp.spi file to assign an SPI to the DSA
keys.&nbsp;
Details on how to do this are documented in the comments of the slp.spi
file
<br>
&nbsp;
</p>
<h3>User Level Access Control</h3>
Plans have been made to provide a mechanism that will enforce user
level
access control that will allow the administrator to specify the users
or
groups that can register services with SLP.

Callbacks</h2>

<h3>
What's a callback function?</h3>
If you are new to asynchronous programming, or have never used callback
functions before, just think of the SLP callback functions as a pieces
of code the you must write but never call directly.&nbsp; Yep, that's right,
you will probably never call your callback function directly, instead,
it will be called by the library when it is ready to report the status
or results of an operation.&nbsp; This allows your program to do other
things while data is being collected by the callback function.&nbsp; Callback
functions are required for all of the major SLP APIs for more information
see <a href="SLPReg.html">SLPReg()</a>,
<a href="SLPDereg.html">SLPDeReg()</a>,
<a href="SLPDelAttrs.html">SLPDelAttrs()</a>,
<a href="SLPFindSrvs.html">SLPFindSrvs()</a>,
<a href="SLPFindAttrs.html">SLPFindAttrs()</a>,
and <a href="SLPFindSrvTypes.html">SLPFindSrvTypes()</a>,
<p>Callback functions must accept the parameters that the caller (the SLP
library) expects to pass to them.&nbsp; This is why callback function types
are defined.&nbsp; See <a href="SLPRegReport.html">SLPRegReport()</a>,
<a href="SLPSrvURLCallback.html">SLPSrvURLCallback()</a>,
<a href="SLPAttrCallback.html">SLPAttrCallback()</a>.
<h3>
What's different about SLP callback functions?</h3>
Callbacks are an integral part of the SLP API.&nbsp; Developers usually
associate callbacks with asynchronous APIs, but the SLP API uses callbacks
for both synchronous and asynchronous operations.&nbsp; Whether the callback
is called synchronously or asynchronously, depends on the <tt><a href="SLPOpen.html#isasync">isasync</a>

</tt>parameter in the call to <tt><a href="SLPOpen.html">SLPOpen()</a></tt>.&nbsp;
Remember the following rules and you should not have any problems with
your callback functions.
<ul>
<li>
Callback functions are called in both synchronous and asynchronous cases.&nbsp;
The only difference is that in a synchronous case, the initiating function
(SLPReg(), SLPFindSrvs(), etc) will block until all results are reported
to the callback function.</li>

<li>
The memory passed in to callback functions is owned by the library.&nbsp;
i.e. the callback must <tt>strdup()</tt> strings before using them permanently
because the memory passed in will be <tt>free()</tt>d by the library when
the callback returns.</li>

<li>
<blink>Make your callback functions as efficient as possible.</blink>&nbsp;
This is especially important when a call is made with an async <tt><a href="SLPTypes.html#SLPHandle">SLPHandle</a></tt>
because results are not collected or collated by the library before the
callback function is called.&nbsp; In other words,&nbsp; in async mode,
the library will call the callback each time a reply message is received
until the request times out.</li>

<li>
If the <tt>errcode</tt> upon entry to the callback is set to anything but
<tt>SLP_OK</tt>,
the rest of the parameters may be invalid.&nbsp; Check the error code first.</li>

<li>
Use the <tt>cookie</tt> parameter.&nbsp; It is the best way to get information
to and from your callback.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
How does OpenSLP library handle asynchronous operation?</h3>
When an SLP library call is made with an SLPHandle that was opened in async
mode, the library does everything it can with out blocking.&nbsp; It then
creates a thread (hopefully a user level thread) and returns SLP_OK.&nbsp;
The newly created thread processes the request (possibly blocking to wait
for data to arrive from the network) and calls the callback function as
data is received.
<p>An important thing to remember is that <i>no collection or collation
of results is performed by the library when a call is initiated in async
mode. </i>This means that the callback may be called multiple times with
the same result.&nbsp; This would happen for example if two SAs or DAs
maintained the same registration.
<h3>
How does OpenSLP library handle synchronous operation?</h3>
When an SLP library call is made with an SLPHandle that was opened in sync
mode, the library will not create a thread.&nbsp; Instead, the calling
thread will perform all processing (which may block) and report results
to the callback function.&nbsp; When in sync mode, all of the results are
collated to ensure no duplicates are returned.&nbsp; The API function call
will not return until all results are finished being reported through the
callback.
<h3>
Why not just have separate synchronous and asynchronous APIs?</h3>
That would have been good choice, but for some reason, the SLP designers
thought their way would be better.&nbsp; OpenSLP API is just an implementation
of a standardized specification.
<h3>
Can I see an example?</h3>
Yes, example code can be found in the documentation for the <a href="SLPReg.html">SLPReg()</a>,
<a href="SLPFindSrvs.html">SLPFindSrv()</a>, <a href="SLPFindAttrs.html">SLPFindAttrs()</a>
and <a href="SLPFindSrvTypes.html">SLPFindSrvTypes()</a> functions.

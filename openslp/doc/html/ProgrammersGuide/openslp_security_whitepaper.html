Abstract</h3>
This document is summary of SLPv2 security discussions along with some
conclusions that suggest direction for future Caldera sponsored development
of the
<a href="www.openslp.org">OpenSLP</a> implementation of Service
Location Protocol.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Introduction</h3>
Early in December 2000, it was suggested that OpenSLP be submitted for
security review by noted security expert Olaf Kirch.&nbsp;&nbsp; Olaf offered
some very useful feedback including a suggestion to implement optional
SLPv2 authentication as specified by <a href="http://www.openslp.org/doc/rfc/rfc2608.txt">RFC
2608 section 9.2.</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Olaf was worried that in the absence
of SLPv2 authentication,&nbsp; users of OpenSLP might unknowingly trust
malicious services that have been setup to "masquerade" as legitimate services.&nbsp;&nbsp;
In Olaf's estimation leaving out SLP authentication opens a security hole
that is not&nbsp; acceptable.&nbsp; With respect to <i>Volution</i>'s use
of SLP to locate services Olaf wrote the following:
<blockquote><tt>"Not authenticating registration and deregistration requests
is clearly inacceptable in an environment where there's a non-zero security
awareness. If everyone is able to change the LDAP server Volution uses
to obtain its information from, then we might as well replace /bin/login
with a symlink to /bin/bash"&nbsp; -- Olaf Kirch</tt></blockquote>
The initial response to Olaf's security review was one of complete compliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Code changes were quickly made for the next release of OpenSLP (ver 0.8.1)
to resolve all security issues <i>except</i> implementation of SLPv2 authentication
which was expected to be an involved change that would take several days
to complete.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a couple days of research, it became
obvious that the addition of SLPv2 security would be much more complex
than simply writing several hundred lines of security enabling code.&nbsp;&nbsp;
The final conflict eventually boiled down to a fundamental security / usability
tradeoff that would be unresolvable even with a perfect implementation.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Objective of SLP</h3>
SLP can be thought of as a very simple global service registry (or directory).&nbsp;&nbsp;
Software entities that provide services register with SLP so that software
entities that want to use a services can locate them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SLP offers a very simple mapping of service types (or characteristics)
to service URLs.&nbsp;&nbsp; This means that only the <i>type or characteristics</i>
of a service need to be known in order for a user or application to locate
a service for&nbsp; use.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The major feature SLP provides
is usability.&nbsp;&nbsp; Basically, SLP allows application developers
to write more usable and manageable software.&nbsp;&nbsp; With SLP users
no longer need to memorize network addresses, host names or other information
to configure their client applications and administrators do not have to
set up elaborate means to supply this information.
<p>In discussing security problems associated with SLP it is important
to note two things&nbsp; from <a href="http://www.openslp.org/doc/rfc/rfc2608.txt">section
1 of RFC 2608</a>:
<ul>
<li>
SLP is designed for enterprise networks not as a solution for the global
Internet</li>

<li>
The goal of SLP is to provide a framework that allows developers to write
software that is user friendly and easily managed.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
SLP Security</h3>
Imagine now that in an enterprise environment there is a malicious or overly
curious individual that would like to obtain confidential information.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SLP could be exploited to obtain information from software that was otherwise
secured by virtue of manual configuration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example,
an OpenSource help desk application consisting of "server" and "client"
software is SLP enabled because the network administrators got tired of
helping employees set up the "client" software with location and configuration
information used to connect with the "server" software.
<p>Since the source code is readily available, a sneaky employee makes
a few modifications to the server code that allows him to obtain user names
and passwords.&nbsp; He recompiles the source and brings up the "rogue"
help desk server.&nbsp; Since the "rogue" help desk server and the real
help desk server both have similar SLP registerations, it is possible that
clients may connect to the "rogue" server instead of the real one.&nbsp;
When the users log in, the "rogue" server saves off a copies of user names
and passwords.&nbsp; The malicious employee can use these user names and
passwords later to impersonate other people.
<p>In order to prevent this type of attack, SLP is designed so that services
registrations and requests can be made with authentication information.&nbsp;&nbsp;
When properly implemented, SLP requests can be issued that will only return
registrations made by trusted services.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With SLP Security
enabled developers could trust that the service information returned by
the SLP API&nbsp; (URLs and configuration information).&nbsp; They do not
have to question (as much) whether the service at the other end of the
provided URL is a rogue because SLP can guarantee that services have been
"blessed" by administrators by virtue of key information.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
SLP Security vs SLP Usability</h3>
It is a well known fact that any increase in security inevitable reduces
usability for the legitimate user.&nbsp; This is especially true with&nbsp;
SLP security -- establishment of trust is unacceptable barrier to SLP usability.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
The whole reason for using SLP in the first place is to allow "plug and
play" features to be built into applications!
<p>Due to the lack of PKI standards, establishing the trust needed to ensure
that service registrations can be authenticated would require manual distribution
of key material.&nbsp;&nbsp; One solution would be to have the administrator
verify the authenticity of a single SLP host key or certificate which would
authenticate all services provided from a given host, but this would not
prevent an attacker from masquerading services if they have access to the
authenticated machine.&nbsp;&nbsp; A more secure approach is to provide
per service or per user keys at the expense of increased manual intervention
to establish authenticity of numerous keys or certificates.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Wait... even with SLP secured, there is still the possiblity of DNS, DHCP
or ARP spoofing, so you are still not secure.
<p>After a few minutes of meditation it becomes evident that in order to
be totally safe, applications need to establish the security of their own
end to end communications.&nbsp; Two very good examples are PGP and SSH.&nbsp;
Neither application makes any assumptions about the reliability of intermediate
protocols.&nbsp; Everything is suspect from DNS to ARP.&nbsp;&nbsp; Suppose
that a specialized application was written that used PGP encrypted messages
to communicate.&nbsp;&nbsp; SLP is chosen to locate remote users of the
same application.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, assume that none of the SLP security
features are implemented, is the application at risk?&nbsp; The answer
is no because care was taken by the application developer to secure his
own end to end communication.
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
IETF Workgroup (srvloc) Discussion</h3>
The idea that authentication belongs in the application itself and not
in the location protocol (or other intermediate protocols) was brought
up for discussion on the IETF Service Location workgroup mailing list with
the following post entitled "Theoretical SLP security discussion (long)":
<blockquote><tt>SLPv2 is designed to be able to authenticate agents. In
other words, SLPV2 can guarantee that SAs and DAs are trustworthy. With
a proper SLPv2 implementation and installation, UAs can be sure that replies
to SLP requests come from trustworthy agents. There is no need to wonder
if a responding agent is representing malicious services. For example,
with SLPv2 authentication, I can request a service of type "service:ldap"
and implicitly trust that the service urls I receive in return are ldap
servers that are considered trustworthy by whoever set up the SLP installations.</tt>
<p><tt>Sounds pretty nice doesn't it -- at least until you start thinking
about what is required to deliver key information (certificates) that makes
trust relationships possible. I think I'm safe in saying that without exception,
no automated delivery of key information is secure unless it requires actual
validation by a human that results in some form of real-life action (phone
call, hand delivery, etc).</tt>
<p><tt>Administration of trust relationships are completely un-addressed
by the SLPv2 and SLP API specs -- which is probably why authentication
is considered an optional feature. One might even take the position that
SLPv2 Authentication invalidates the SLP's claim to reduce administrative
workload as there is no way to deploy secure SLP without significant (manual)
administrative overhead to establish certificate or key information trust.</tt>
<p><tt>In contemplating implementation and use of SLPv2 authentication
in OpenSLP we found that there is nearly nothing in the way of standardized
certificate delivery mechanisms that might actually make SLPv2 authentication
possible. We did find bits and pieces from OpenSSL and various signing
utilities, which lead us to start questioning why we were trying to authenticate
services via SLP anyway? Why not just let services authenticate themselves?</tt>
<p><tt>An analogy from real life... I need to call an associate and relay
some confidential information. I write down his number as it was left on
my voice mail and place the phone call. BEFORE I exchange sensitive information
the individual on the other line, I authenticate their identity (recognize
their voice, etc). Trusting the information available on my voice mail
is not required (as the number may have be to an airport pay phone). Implicitly
trusting a phone number from the white pages or any other source is not
required (or expected) as long as the callers can authenticate themselves.</tt>
<p><tt>Likewise, SLP delivered information need not be trusted to be useful.
As long as the entity providing a service and the entity using the service
can authenticate each other -- separate from the mechanism used to discover
or locate one another. One problem is that many services do not have authentication
capabilities -- which is not too much of a problem because most services
don't have SLP capabilities either. In the end, the only problem is that
developers are just beginning to write secure software. If secure service
and client software were indeed available, there would not be any need
for SLP authentication.</tt>
<p><tt>Having not heard additional comment from other experts, it is my
opinion the SLP need not bear the burden of authenticating services. The
burden of authentication should be placed on the services and their clients
rather than on a protocol valued for simplicity and ease of use, administration,
and deployment.</tt>
<p><tt>Please comment. Do you agree or disagree? Why?</tt>
<br>&nbsp;</blockquote>
Response from ebi@cup.hp.com:
<blockquote><tt>My take on this would be that it needs to be implemented
and the people deploying it should have the option of enabling/disabling
it.</tt>
<p><tt>Because if this is not implemented, I can see a potential denial
of service attack, where a rogue SA/DA, keeps on responding to all the
discovers sent by the UA. Even though the authentication might fail when
the application tries to authenticate using other means. It can stop the
UA from finding the correct SA/DA, there by creating a denial of service
attack.</tt>
<p><tt>On the other hand managing keys does make the protocol heavy weight.
The problem of effective key management issue, needs to be solved for most
other protocols (like DHCP) as well. Until then, we need</tt>
<br><tt>to be doing the key management manually or use what openSSL uses,
and when there is an optimum key management solution, we can integrate
into that.</tt></blockquote>

<p><br>Rebuttal from mpeterson@caldera.com:
<blockquote><tt>I do not believe that the "denial of service" attack scenario
described above is much of an issue.</tt>
<p><tt>I think that it is worth clarifying that receiving incorrect information
(service URLs of rogue services from rogue DA/SAs) is not a problem that
involves the "SLP UA portion" of a client application. The problem you
describe above involves the portions of the client application that *use*
information delivered by SLP -- the "UA portion" is only in charge of *getting*
the information not using it. In other words, the problem you describe
above is an SLP usage problem not an SLP problem.</tt>
<p><tt>Regardless of whether or not SLPv2 authentication is implemented
and configured, client applications must not expect that SLP guarantees
availability. SLP could not possibly be expected to guarantee the state
of the network or the persistent state of the registered service. Suppose
that a service registers with SLP just before a WAN outage. At least for
a certain amount of time clients would experience the same "denial of service"
symptoms you describe above. The real solution is to encourage developers
to use the entire list of service URLs. If usage (connection to or authentication
to) one service fails, the client application should try the next.</tt>
<p><tt>Denial of service scenarios like the one you describe are impossible
to prevent. The only protection against denial of service attacks is fear.
Yes, security by fear. Remember, "SLP is intended to function within networks
under cooperative administrative control."&nbsp; The above mentioned attack
would be easy to detect, track and resolve; which means that it would not
probably not be much of a problem in the environments SLP is written to
run in (how many rogue DHCP servers do you see on your network).</tt>
<p><tt>In private network environments, the security problems that you
need to worry about are those that allow confidential data to be compromised
(especially if it can be done in ways can not be detected.) Denial of service
attacks to not compromise data.</tt>
<p><tt>The argument from my original post is that even if SLP authentication
was implemented and configured correctly with (magically) delivered certificates,
there would still be significant service specific security risks that would
be dangerous even in private networks. Upon close inspection SLP authentication
appears to solve only those security problems that are not overly relevant
to private networks in the first place. (Please, if I'm wrong here, give
me some examples...)</tt>
<p><tt>I agree fully that SLP without authentication is in the same realm
(security wise) as DHCP. My question remains -- Is this really a problem
in private networks? If so, why? DHCP continues to be a widely deployed
and extremely useful technology. One of the most useful aspects of DHCP
(and SLP) is that there is no need for extensive configuration. Add requirements
for establishing trust (certificates, keys, etc.) and the "plug and play"
features of DHCP and SLP are gone.&nbsp; As this is a "theoretical discussion"
I might mention that security is not free. There is always a usability
vs. security trade off. I might also mention that sometimes *lack of* security
is a feature if the goal is usability.</tt></blockquote>

<p><br>Response from ebi@cup.hp.com:
<blockquote><tt>Let me give you another example. If I have a workstation
on the shared lan where my manager's PC is also there. Some companies restrict
root access to people on the main network. So I cannot sniff around to
find password. If there is no security in SLP, then&nbsp; I can register
one of the test machines, which would be in a different network (for which
I have the root access to) as the pop server. Then I get the user name
and password of my manager's pop account (The same thing can be done for
a print spooler or a file server).</tt></blockquote>
Rebuttal from mpeterson@caldera.com:
<blockquote><tt>Again, Don't you think this is more an illustration of
the weakness of POP3 protocol and mail server/client software than it is
of SLP? I would argue that its is that POP3 needs the security boost --
after all it is in the business of securing an end to end communication.
SLP is not designed to solve the end-to-end authentication problem ...
or is it?</tt>
<p><tt>On the other hand, you do allude to a very valid point -- that most
traditional and widely deployed "end-to-end" service specific protocols
and software are not capable of secure service authentication. (It is usually
possible authenticate the user, but client software can rarely authenticate
the server which means that there is no establishment of trust before sending
client side user credentials.)</tt>
<p><tt>Should SLP be tasked with solving this problem? The answer is definitely
YES if it can be done without completely squashing major SLP usability
features ("plug and play" features). I guess I just don't see how this
can be done.</tt></blockquote>

<p><br>The discussion eventually involves several engineers from a number
of organizations and becomes quite lengthy.&nbsp;&nbsp; At least, the exchange
included above should give a taste of the arguments involved.&nbsp; For
those that are interested in reading the entire thread, it can be found

<h3>
Conclusions</h3>
For those that are not willing to endure the tedium of reading the entire
mailing list discussion,&nbsp; the conclusion was eventually made (at least
by the author) that though SLP authentication may be&nbsp; appropriate
in some specialized SLP deployments, it is probably not beneficial in normal
network computer environments.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This conclusion is based
on the following premises:
<ul>
<li>
Implementation of SLP authentication in the absence of public key infrastructure
standards would require enough manual configuration to invalidate all claims
SLP has to increased usability.</li>

<li>
Common helper protocols DNS, DHCP, IP, even ARP are currently insecure
for usability reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp; SLP fits into this category of protocols
where lack of security may be considered a feature when it allows for maximal
usability.</li>

<li>
Given the lack of security in the above mentioned (and other) protocols
self-established authentication of end to end communication is required
anyway for secure communication of network software entities.</li>

<li>
In the presence of appropriate end to end security mechanisms,&nbsp; SLP
related security attacks are limited to the realm of "denial of service"
or "disruptions" -- even when <i>no</i> authentication is implemented in
SLP.&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words there is not a risk of compromise of confidential
information that can be attributed to SLP as long as appropriate end to
end security is established.</li>
</ul>
So, for the OpenSLP project, there are not any plans to implement SLPv2
security.&nbsp;&nbsp; (This may change in the future depending on the success
of ongoing PKI standardization efforts.)&nbsp;&nbsp; There are, however,
many things that could be done to reduce opportunities for "denial of service
attacks" or other malicious SLP related disruptions.&nbsp;&nbsp; These
will be addressed in future versions of OpenSLP.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Also, in order to inform developers about the importance of writing secure
applications, plans have been made to include an SLP&nbsp;Security HOWTO
as part of the OpenSLP&nbsp;Documentation.

<h3>
Declaration</h3>
<tt>#include &lt;slp.h></tt>
<p><tt>void SLPClose(<a href="SLPTypes.html#SLPHandle">SLPHandle</a> <a href="#hslp">hslp</a>)</tt>
<br>&nbsp;
<h3>
Description</h3>
Frees all resources associated with the handle.&nbsp; If the handle was
invalid, the functions returns silently.&nbsp; Any outstanding synchronous
or asynchronous operations are canceled so their callback functions will
not be called any longer.
<p>In the OpenSLP&nbsp;implementation, SLPHandles are used to cache information
that is costly (in terms of network usage and time) to obtain.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Since the RFC 2614 API does not specify APIs to initialize the implementation
library, OpenSLP&nbsp;keeps track of the number of SLPHandles that are
open.&nbsp;&nbsp; Several global library data structures are initialized
when the first SLPHandle is opened and maintained until the last SLPHandle
is closed.&nbsp; Therefore, it is most efficient to leave SLPHandles open
for as long as you will need them (often for the entire life of a process).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you can help it, DO&nbsp;NOT&nbsp;make a habit of opening and closing
SLPHandles frequently.
